Process - A unit of execution 
        - States of Process - Ready - Run - Waiting - Blocking - Killed - Swapped Out
        - Process related linux commands - ps, top
        - Process States details - PID, Priority ID, Heap Segment, Stack segment, Code segment, Data Segment, Socket 
        - IPC - FIFO, FILE, PIPE, SOCKET, Message QUEUE, Shared Memory, Semaphore 
        
        - Advantages  - If one process kills doenst affet on other process in system.
        - Limitation  - Huge context switch time
       
Threads - Light Process, Runs inside process 
        - Share all except Stack segment 
        - Commands top 
        
        Advantages - Improves the parallelism within process 
                   - Low CPU Context switch time
        Limitation - If one threads kill it affect on other threads
                   -  Need to synchronise threads
                   

Synchronisation 
         -  It is mechanism which we avoids the race condition over the critical section.
         -  race condition - two or more thread writting same shared memory area and it running squence generate inconsistend or unpredicable result.
         -  Critical section - it is section of code area which produce different, inconsitent and unpredicatable result when mulitple thread try to access it same time.
         -  properties of synchronisation - Mutual Exclustion, Progress and Bounded waiting
         
         Advantages - Avaid race condition over critical section 
         
         Limitation - Slower due to conext switches
                    - deadlock
                    
Mutex   - It is mechanism which we avoids the race condition over the critical section.
        - Lock and Unlock Operation with binary or boolean variable, Locking mechanism, blocking threads adds in blocking queue
        - It has properties - Mutual exclusion, No Premtion and Lock and Unlock are automic operations
        - Allow only one thread to enter in crictical section
        - Implement abstraction and encapsulation 
        - Example Spinlock and TryLock
        
        Limitaion - Allows only one thread to enter in critical section

Seamaphore
        - It is mechanism which we avoids the race condition over the critical section.
        - Wait and Signal opearion and automatic, Non-negative Seamaphore Singaling Mechanism, waited thraeds present on waiting queue
        - It has properties - Mutual exclusion, No Premtion and Lock and Unlock are automic operations
        - Doesnt provide abstrac encapsulation 
        - Example Binary and Conting seamaphore
        
        Limitation - Doest provide abstraction and encapsulated operations 
                   - might get in race condition between thread got signal call and getting exclusive lock 
                   - only set sigle to single thread
        
Bearier  - 
         - Thread killing doesnt affect on other threads
         
         
Conditinal Variable - 
         - Send single to all waiting threads 
         - Provide abscraction adn encapsulation 
         
         
 Deadlock - Sitution where infinite starvation or therad waitng for lock which holding by other indefinitely 
          - condidation for deadlock - Hold and wait, No premtion, Circula Wait, Mutual exclusion
          
          How to avoid Deadlock
           - use trylock and timeboudlock 
           - bankers algorithem
